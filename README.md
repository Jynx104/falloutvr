#FNV VR: It Just Works Guide by Jynx
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a semi in-depth guide on modding FNV to make it a decent VR experience. I'm going to assume you have basic knowledge of modding going
into this, and if you don't I recommend checking out Gopher's channel on Youtube. He has plenty of videos for modding NV in 2021 and makes it
very easy for you.

The main program you need is Vorpx. Its a third party program that makes non-VR games, well, VR. Currently it costs $40 USD and you can buy it
at: https://www.vorpx.com/ please don't flame VorpX we all know its not the best but it works if you give it enough time.

Getting NV to work in VR isn't just as simple as downloading Vorpx and playing the game. There is a lot of tweaking you have to do in
VorpX and in NV to make it playable. If you don't do this, your FOV will not match, dialogue will make you puke, and trying to do combat is 
nearly impossible. Its a nightmare ;). One thing about VorpX is that its not perfect. You will have to use the 'screen peak' option frequently 
when using the pause menu and while in dialogue. The screen peak feature basically pulls your camera back and puts you into a cinema mode 
so you can see the full screen.

Enough talking, heres the steps:

Step 1: VORPX: get ready to get sick

Download Vorpx and launch the Configure vorpX app. Go to Cloud Profiles, in Profile Author search for Jynx104. Click import settings,
apply and close, now you will have my tweaked profile for full 3D settings and motion sickness reduction. Keybindings are mapped to Oculus Quest controllers
but I'm not sure if that carries over (would be awesome if someone with a Quest could let me know)

Step 2: NECESSARY MODS: please dont ask me why your game is crashing :)

The most time you will spend with this is not tweaking VR setting like you'd think. Most of this is downloading necessary mods to make your game
an easier and more enjoyable experience. Default FOV and HUDS do not work at all. I recommend launching NV in Vorpx before modding your game
just to see what I am talking about and to have a better idea on how you want your game to look and play. I wont be linking mods here or posting any guides
to script extenders, bug fixes, or anything like that. You should have that all done already. I'm just going to be focusing on mods for immersion
and playability.

MODS:
Mod Configuration Menu
UIO
Shiloh DS - Clean Pipboy Screen
One HUD - oHUD
Immersive HUD - iHUD
DarnUI (not on nexus you can download it here: https://www.moddb.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/addons/darnified-ui-v04 make sure you get your 
compatibility patches for it or else you'll have issues)
Loot Menu (Fallout 4 loot menu, no explination there)
No Blur Menus and UI FIXED
MTUI
The HUD Editor (Most important one in this list! Make sure this is installed correctly!)
FOV Slider (necessary to see, customize your FOV to your liking)
Faster DialogZoom
Immsersive Pickup Sounds
Audible Bush Sounds
No Screen Blood
HD Glass Impact Decals 
HD Fire and Explosions
EVE Visual Enhancements
ClearWindows
Bullet Tracers New Vegas
Realtime Player Death
Dusty Distance (for lod popping)
NoScopeWobble
noautoaim
No Weapon Movement Penalty
Motion Sickness Destroyer
Just Vanilla Sprint
Faster VATS
Faster Terminals
Enhanced Camera
5x Faster Waiting
No More Double Open And Close Sounds
No 1st Person Camera Movement
Realistic Movement1.0
FP Gun Follows Crosshairs
Faster Pip-Boy Animation (I use 2x, use whatever you feel comfortable with)
Diagonal Movement
B42 Inertia
Asurah Reanimation Pack
Tutorial Killer

These are all mods I consider essential. Without them you're going to be blind during combat and you're going to get motion sickness trying to run from Deathclaws.
After everything is installed and running good you're going to want to tweak all your script extender ini's to your liking. I'm not going to give a guide on what 
to tweak because everyone has different sensitivity to VR and you will just have to set it up how you like it. 
Please remember mod load orders are a thing, and so are patches. If you have an incompatibility with your HUD its most likely because you missed a patch somewhere
or your load order is wrong. I used the Nexus Mod Manager to do this so all you yuppies with MO should do just fine. (kiddingggg)

Step 3: EDITING THE HUD: do you need a hug yet?

At this point you should have everything installed and ready to go.... hopefully....
Start up your game and start a new save (I would download Nfokas1234's custom save game from the nexus for editing your HUD and testing your game before starting
your actual playthrough https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40550). Pause your game and look at the bottom left corner of your screen. Click the up arrow box
and The HUD Editor will come up. Click Edit HUD. This is where you really will feel the game turn into a VR game, were close!
From my videos you can see how I like to use my HUD (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO5tFf0E3po&list=PLWhR6mp57veNOUqrQ5SFCpb74noMDK1TI) but you absolutely don't
have to do that. Customize it to how you want it! Thats the beauty of NV right? I personally like a minimalistic HUD and only want to see certain things during
combat and while I'm exploring. This is where Immersive HUD comes in. If you like a simplistic HUD you can use that mod to disable HUD elements after combat,
which definitely helps with the immersion.

Step 4: ??? play the game
Once you've got your UI how you like it and you're feeling brave, get out into New Vegas. This game does require some strong VR feet but once you get use to it
its not that bad. 
This is a very simplistic view at geting this game playable in VR. Please please have modding AND VR experience before going into this and expect your game to not work
at some point. You're doing things that just aren't meant to be done with a 10 year old game, and we don't have anything like OpenMWVR yet (someone get on it!!!)


Thanks for reading, this is just a quick guide to get you on your feet and give you the tools to do this. Hopefully this helps some people that are interested
in the FNV VR experience. Remember everyone, It Just Works.
